        <h1 class="header">Why subscribe?</h1>
        <p class="main-content">You might be asking yourself why should I add another subscription to the never-ending list. This is different. You see, I personally recorded every video on this page, this isn't anything professional, it's just a website ran by <a href="/about-me" class="me">me</a>, a random high schooler. I just added the subscription feature, so people could support me and give me an incentive to continue work on this website. I hope you'll consider subscribing, as it's 5 dollars a month, less than the cost of a coffee. And, in return you'll get access to higher qualities of video.</p>
